\subsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GOF Singleton pattern} To ensure the correct behavior of the statemachine, the Singleton pattern 
    must be used, it ensures that only one instance of every object class can exist at any given time.
        
    \item \textbf{GOF state pattern} This pattern ensures that an object changes behaviour when it changes state, 
    but to the outside world it looks like a new object. Instead of enumeration, the state and its behaviour is 
    encapsulated in multiple classes, where our object can delegate to the current state class. 
    \item \textbf{Active Object pattern} The main purpose of the active object pattern, is it separate 
    method invocation from method execution, by decoupling. This lets us asynchronously invoke methods while
    not tying up valuable time to execute those methods, by having separate threads do both scheduling and execution.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Active object pattern must implement the provided interface
            \item not be blocking
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Follow the provided state pattern} With the assignment, the \textit{EmbeddedSystemX} class
    was provided, which outlined the overall requirement for the application.
\end{itemize}
