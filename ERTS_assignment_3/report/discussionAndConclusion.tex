\section{Discussion}
Looking at the requirements for the overall system, the final implementaion is a close attempt, however
minor functionality is still missing, specifically the suspend mechanism, which should halt the the 
thread execution.

looking at the Active object implementation, because the system is dealing with almost
instantenously executed code, there is no real consequence of execution time, which is
why an artificial thread sleep is introduced. This is also why the all the futures 
used in the implementation are void. They are merely used to indicate that some has been done
however they don't return anything. And all state processing is being held in the Servant

As to whether the desired implementation lives up to the provided diagram is up for discussion,
some of the descriptors, specifically "configX", "eventX/responseM n eventX" seemed a 
little vague, so some artistic liberty was necessary to create a satisfactory solution.
