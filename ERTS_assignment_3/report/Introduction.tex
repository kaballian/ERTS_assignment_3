\section{Introduction}
The main goal is this assignment is to implement a simulated version of an embedded system
using state patterns, more specifically a concurrent state machine, where the 
handling of event are processed, by using \textit{GOF State pattern}, \text{Singletong pattern} 
and the \textit{Active object pattern}


In this assignment, the application has been implemented by adhering to these requirements, and following
the provided state diagram given with the assignment. 
Some liberty has been taken in terms of implementation, regarding how to interact with the system, but
also how the states and classes has been used and implemented. The goal of this report
is to explain the major outlines of the decisions made along, 
with visual descriptions and depictions. This includes large code snippets and UML diagrams which
will serve as context.

Included with this report is the full code implementation, an executeable file, all UML diagrams 
and code to recreate/recompile the diagrams.
